Heart Disease Analysis (EDA)
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset collected from Kaggle. The goal is to analyze key health indicators and uncover patterns related to the presence of heart disease.

📊 Objective
To explore the dataset, clean the data, visualize relationships between features, and identify important factors that contribute to heart disease.

🔍 Key Insights
Most individuals aged 80 and above are more likely to have heart disease.

Important features influencing heart disease include cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and age.

Visualizations such as heatmaps, histograms, and box plots helped in identifying trends and correlations.
